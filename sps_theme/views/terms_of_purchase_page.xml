                                                amicably resolve any controversy, dispute or difference arising out of the

                                                Rules of the AAA, but shall be administered by AAA only if AAA appoints the
                                                arbitrator. The arbitrator may award attorney’s fees and costs as part of the
                                                award. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and may be
                                                entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. All proceedings

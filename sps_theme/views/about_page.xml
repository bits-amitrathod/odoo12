                                            <p>
                                               SPS is a leader in providing cost-saving solutions for healthcare facilities across the United States who choose to save money without sacrificing quality of care.
                                                We accomplish this by <span> presenting hospitals and surgery centers with two ways to save </span> on their high-volume surgical disposables.

                                                    <p><span>SPS provides a liquidation solution for surgical disposables</span> when they become non-moving and are no longer being used by the facility. This can be due to product conversions, contract changes, or physician departures. We purchase these surgical disposables that would otherwise remain un-used and eventually expire on the shelves of the OR, injecting cash directly into the hospital’s budget.</p>

We sell the same high-volume products that your facility is currently buying from vendors, at an even greater discount than top tier pricing. We also provide the flexibility to purchase individual items in "eaches," rather than in cases, which helps in the unique case of a preferential product that is outside your normal buying patterns (Physician Preference Item)—and avoids disrupting any contract compliances.</p>

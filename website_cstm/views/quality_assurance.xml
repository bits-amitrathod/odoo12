                                <p>Surgical Product Solutions (SPS) is a solution based company that partners with
                                    healthcare facilities to recover significant budget costs by purchasing their
                                    un-used, in-date surgical surplus. At the same time, SPS provides supplemental cost
                                    savings and flexibility when purchasing high volume surgical products that customers
                                    are currently utilizing.
                                </p>
                                <p>SPS’s focus is simple: helping customers become higher quality healthcare providers
                                    without compromise. In order to maintain a high level of integrity, Surgical Product
                                    Solutions upholds strict records and business practices when it comes to quality
                                    control, accuracy, and attention to detail.
                                </p>
                                <p>The FDA has made a regulatory decision to limit the tracking, registration and
                                    listing requirements for distributors of medical devices. As a result, SPS
                                    institutes a compliance program that includes specific purchasing and quality
                                    control best practices. These best practices were designed to significantly reduce
                                    the likelihood that SPS could unintentionally purchase products from a seller that
                                    could not demonstrate its legitimate ownership. SPS only purchases inventory from
                                    licensed facilities, including hospitals, surgery centers, and medical device
                                    distributors. The best practices that are implemented include the following: (a)
                                    restrictions on eligible vendors; (b) required paperwork for all transactions
                                    including signed purchase offer, and invoice; (c) quality control procedures to
                                    ensure the maintenance of safety and efficiency upon receipt, storage and
                                    distribution.
                                </p>
                                <p>In addition, SPS has established stringent quality control systems to assure product
                                    integrity &amp; employs smart technology to assure inventory record accuracy. The
                                    company’s facility is a climate controlled, hygienic warehouse equipped with backup
                                    generators and 24 hour video / security surveillance. SPS strives to provide the
                                    best possible service through an advanced inventory tracking software that resides
                                    on enterprise-class servers in an offsite data center where data is backed up daily.
                                    SPS distributes inventory of surgical disposables to health systems, community
                                    hospitals, rural hospitals, as well as ambulatory and same-day surgery centers on a
                                    daily basis that trust in the quality of product provided.

                                <p>To avoid product deterioration, SPS employs an automated distribution system. The
                                    inventory software directs which specific lot number / expiration date should be
                                    picked for each customer order in an attempt to maintain proper stock rotation.
                                    Unless noted otherwise, the inventory software will pick the relevant LOT number /
                                    expiration date combination to fulfill the order. The software is programmed to pick
                                    the shortest expiration date first but can be overridden upon request if longer
                                    expiration dates are required by the customer.

                                    program exceeds requirements by voluntarily tracking and recording lot numbers.
                                    SPS’s inventory system tracks Expiration, Product Number, LOT number, as well as
                                    package care requirements for each product. This real time fulfillment system
                                    guarantees accurate order completion.

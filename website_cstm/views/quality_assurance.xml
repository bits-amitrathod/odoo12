                                <p>Surgical Product Solutions (SPS) is a solution-based company that partners with healthcare facilities to recover significant budget costs by purchasing their un-used, in-date surgical
                                    surplus. At the same time, SPS provides supplemental cost savings and flexibility when purchasing the same high volume surgical products they are currently utilizing.
                                </p>
                                <p>SPS’s focus is simple: helping customers become higher quality healthcare providers without compromise.  In order to maintain a high level of integrity, Surgical Product Solutions upholds
                                    strict record and business practices when it comes to quality control, accuracy, and attention to detail.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hospitals are in critical need of medical device solutions that deliver long-term fiscal and patient- focused value. SPS believes suppliers of healthcare products and services must deliver
                                    these cost saving solutions that the hospitals need without added risk to the patient.  For this reason, SPS’s business serves a valuable purpose.
                                </p>
                                <p>The FDA has made a regulatory decision to limit the tracking, registration and listing requirements for distributors of PMDs. As a result, SPS institutes a compliance program that includes
                                    specific purchasing and quality control protocols.  The program was designed to eliminate or significantly reduce the likelihood that SPS could unintentionally purchase products from a
                                    seller that could not demonstrate its legitimate ownership. SPS only purchases inventory from licensed facilities, including hospitals, surgery centers, and medical device distributors. The
                                    purchasing protocols include the following: (i) restrictions on eligible vendors; (ii) required paperwork for all transactions including purchase order, invoice and bill of sale; (iii) restrictions as
                                    to payment method and; (iv) quality systems procedures to ensure the maintenance of safety and efficacy upon receipt, storage and distribution.
                                </p>
                                <p>In addition, SPS operates as a viable enterprise that has established stringent quality control systems and technology to assure product integrity and accuracy. The company’s facility is a
                                    climate controlled, hygienic warehouse equipped with backup generators and 24-hour video / security surveillance.   SPS strives to provide the best possible service through advanced
                                    inventory tracking software that resides on enterprise-class servers in an offsite data center where data is backed up daily. Moreover, the SPS staff exudes a level of professionalism and
                                    personal attention rarely found in today’s healthcare distributor environment.  SPS distributes inventory of surgical disposables to health systems, community hospitals, rural hospitals, as
                                    well as ambulatory and same-day surgery centers on a daily basis that trust in the quality of product provided.  The staff at SPS is always available to accommodate tours of our facility
                                    upon request.

                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The customer must be a person or entity with authority to own the merchandise – pursuant to Title 21, United States Code.

                                    </li>
                                     <li>If the customer is a remanufacturer of the PMDs, SPS obtains the customer’s FDA registration number.
                                    </li>
                                     <li>If the customer is a repackager, SPS obtains the customer’s FDA registration number.
                                    </li>
                                      <li>SPS does not sell any merchandise to a manufacturer’s representative/agent.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li>All sellers must be able to prove they have good and marketable title to the merchandise being sold and that the product being sold has been stored and maintained
                                        properly. To establish this, facilities must be willing to demonstrate to SPS upon request:

                                    <li>A record of the purchase of the merchandise together with a copy of the invoice and evidence of payment for the merchandise.

                                            <li>  The record must show that the merchandise was purchased from a person or entity with authority to own the merchandise – pursuant to Title 21 of the

                                                from whom you are purchasing the merchandise.

                                <p>To avoid product deterioration, SPS practices first in first out (FIFO) distribution system.  The state-of-the-art software directs which specific lot number / expiration date should be picked
                                    each order to maintain proper stock rotation
                                </p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Although not required within the FDA best practices, the SPS quality assurance program exceeds these requirements by voluntarily tracking and recording lot numbers.  SPS’s inventory
                                    system tracks Expiration, Product Number, LOT number, as well as package care requirements for each product. This real time fulfillment system guarantees accurate order completion.

                                <p>SPS data is kept offsite in a top-of-the-line data center that provides enterprise-class scale and reliability. SPS data is protected by encrypted communication, firewalls, multi-layer access
                                    controls, and encrypted backups. In addition, SPS data is automatically scanned using enterprise-class anti-virus technology. The SPS sever is backs-up data nightly and retains it for 90 days.

                                <p>SPS continuously reviews products for recall. In the event of a recall, the product is identified, segregated, and destroyed.
